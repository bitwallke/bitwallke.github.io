> In this walkthrough, we are going to solve a Misc challenge `Genotype` that was pretty easy to solve and was one of the most solved challenges.

---
> **Objective**: Learn various ways of identifying ciphers and decoding them using online tools.

## Shall we?
1. The challenge description was very vivid, `hackers have some good genes`.    
2. Proceed to search for `DNA ciphers`.

3. Reading the article by `geeksforgeeks.org`, it is evident that data and information can be hidden within `DNA Sequence`.     
4. Head over to google and search for `DNA cipher decoder` and you should find variety of tools to perform this.

5. But wait, that does not look like a flag.    
6. Yes, yes yes...that is no flag. I therefore introduce you to [Dcodefr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), a tool that will automatically detect what kind of cipher a string is encoded with.

7. `dcode.fr` identifies the cipher as `Codons (Genetic Code)` with a very high probability.   
8. Lets now proceede and decode the cipher.

9. And there we get our hidden message `YOUHAVEGOTSOMEWEIRDGENETICSHACKER`.

> **Takeaways**
There are various ways on encoding information. Don't mistake encoding for encryption.
Encoding hides data for compatibility or obfuscation, while encryption protects it with cryptographic strength.
