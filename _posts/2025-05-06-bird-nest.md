> In this section, we are going to reproduce CVE-2025-29927 in a vulnerable instance of Bird Nest, a challenge built to simulate real-world exploitation of CVE-2025-29927 in the BitSiegeCTF 2025.

## üê¶ Challenge Overview: Bird Next

Bird Nest is a minimalist web app built with **Next.js v13.4.12**, where unauthenticated users can view a protected page.

**Objective:** Access the protected page called `Get your flag`.

## üîç CVE-2025-29927

Next.js introduced the internal header `x-middleware-subrequest` to avoid infinite recursion in middleware. This header includes route metadata that tells Next.js which middleware already executed.

### ‚ùó Vulnerability

An attacker can **manipulate** the `x-middleware-subrequest` header and trick Next.js into skipping middleware execution ‚Äî effectively bypassing any checks placed there.

3. After observing that the web application is powered by `Next.js` and that the challenge name was `Bird nest`, this was a big clue on what to research on.
4. Looking online for `Next.js recent vulnerabilities` results in top posts showing articles of `CVE-2025-29927`.

7. Now, using curl, we can add the `X-Middleware-Subrequest` and try access the protected resource.
`curl -H "x-middleware-subrequest: middleware" http://54.152.96.1:3000/protected`

8. For those using Burp suite, proxy your request and intercept traffic while navigating the protected resource.

9. Add the `X-Middleware-Subrequest` header and forward the request.
![alt text](/assets/img/blogs/birds-nest/image-7.png)
10. And there you go! you bypassed authentication and accessed protected resources.
